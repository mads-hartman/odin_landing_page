# odin_landing_page
landing page project

Used html to build the webpage, then used css and flexbox to style. I used the Odin Project's Landing Page Project template, but made my own theme and color scheme. I've been listening to a lot of podcasts about cults lately, which is why this was in my head. I'm not a nut, I promise.
